<section id="articles"><article id="detail"><header>Act Like a Senior Developer - About Clean Code</header><p class="date">â€º November 25, 2009</p>
  <p class="brief">Today it was a hard day for me. As usual, I was looking at a mess around our code base. And the worst thing was that the code that I saw today was not a <em>legacy code</em>:S </p>
  <p>It has enough <u>test coverage</u> and moreover the system was working well. The problem was the conditional logics used all over
    the place. It is almost impossible to follow what's happening and where :S Me and my colleague
    spent 2 whole days trying to understand what the heck was going on. Finally we figured it out
    and did what we wanted to do initially. </p>
  <p>Here, I wanna just stop and speak loudly to all the developers that call themselves <strong>senior</strong> or <strong>principal</strong> or <strong>if (experience != Experiences.JUNIOR):</strong>
  </p>
  <p>People, what's wrong with us? How come newly implemented code base is turning into a mess this
    fast? How come we're allowing such a mess when we see it slowly approaching us like a monster?
    But of course, when it comes to the interviews, we have to ask candidates questions around design
    patterns, real-time problem solving skills, test driven design, and refactoring. And seriously
    is this why we were asking these questions? I'm so emberassed and ashamed of being a <strong>senior</strong> guy today. </p>
  <p>Anyways, long story short, here is a 5 minute crash course about what we forget to foresee: </p>
  <h2>1. Evil Ifs</h2>
  <p>As a <strong>senior</strong> guy, you have to be aware of ifs are evil in most cases. For those who forgot, here is a quick
    do not forget list: </p>
  <h3>allow them when:</h3>
  <p>Condition can be expressed without <em>AND, OR</em> operators: i.e </p>
  <pre class="idle"><span class="Keyword">if</span> (myContainer.hasItems()) {
   <span class="Comment"><span class="Comment">//</span>...</span>
} 
</pre>
  <p>Condition is about an encapsulated field: i.e </p>
  <pre class="idle"><span class="Keyword">if</span> (_isVisible) {
      <span class="Comment"><span class="Comment">//</span>...</span>
} 
</pre>
  <p>Condition is non-float numerical comparison: i.e </p>
  <pre class="idle"><span class="Keyword">if</span> (myCertificates.count() <span class="Keyword">&gt;</span> <span class="Number">3</span>) {
      <span class="Comment"><span class="Comment">//</span>...</span>
} 
</pre>
  <h3>be cautious:</h3>
  <p>When there is one or two _AND_, _OR_ operators: i.e </p>
  <pre class="idle"><span class="Keyword">if</span> (_isVisible <span class="Keyword">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="Keyword">!</span>isParent) {
   <span class="Comment"><span class="Comment">//</span>...</span>
}
<span class="Comment"><span class="Comment">//</span> SOLUTION: refactor (extract method, extract local variable, etc) </span>
</pre>
  <p>When there is negative logic: i.e </p>
  <pre class="idle"><span class="Keyword">if</span> (<span class="Keyword">!</span>_iAmSenior) {
   <span class="Comment"><span class="Comment">//</span>...</span>
}
<span class="Comment"><span class="Comment">//</span> SOLUTION: refactor (make it positive like iAmJunior;</span>
<span class="Comment"><span class="Comment">//</span> positive statements are easy to understand) </span>
</pre>
  <p>When there is a very long condition: i.e </p>
  <pre class="idle"><span class="Keyword">if</span> (myAwesomeServiceImpl.findExtremelyImportantSomething()
                               .equals(myLocalExtremelyImportantThing)) {
      <span class="Comment"><span class="Comment">//</span>...</span>
}
<span class="Comment"><span class="Comment">//</span> SOLUTION: refactor (make it short or extract local variable,</span>
<span class="Comment"><span class="Comment">//</span> trust me your application is not at the point where you should</span>
<span class="Comment"><span class="Comment">//</span> worry about memory or CPU cycles) </span>
</pre>
  <p>When there is a if/else statement: i.e </p>
  <pre class="idle"><span class="Keyword">if</span> (_isVisible) {
   number = getNumberFromMoon();
} <span class="Keyword">else</span> {
   number = <span class="Number">1</span>;
}
<span class="Comment"><span class="Comment">//</span> this creates more than 2 execution paths within one method,</span>
<span class="Comment"><span class="Comment">//</span> make sure you force all the possibilities to block above logic</span>
<span class="Comment"><span class="Comment">//</span> SOLUTION: get rid of the second part if possible as in:</span>
number = <span class="Number">1</span>;
<span class="Keyword">if</span> (_isVisible) {
   number = getNumberFromMoon();
}
<span class="Comment"><span class="Comment">//</span> if it is not this simple, then make sure you created</span>
<span class="Comment"><span class="Comment">//</span> two different executions paths (with different</span>
<span class="Comment"><span class="Comment">//</span> methods/classes) before coming to this point </span>
</pre>
  <h3>don't allow please</h3>
  <p>When it is a null check: </p>
  <pre class="idle"><span class="Keyword">if</span> (item <span class="Keyword">!=</span> <span class="BuiltInConstant">null</span>) {
   <span class="Comment"><span class="Comment">//</span> do something...</span>
}
<span class="Comment"><span class="Comment">//</span> SOLUTION: find the cause of null and eliminate it. </span>
</pre>
  <p>For more information on this topic, please read <a href="http://isagoksu.com/2009/development/java/how-to-avoid-nullpointerexceptions-npe/">my other post</a> about null pointer exceptions. </p>
  <p> When there is more than two <em>AND</em>, <em>OR</em>, <em>NOT</em> operators: i.e </p>
  <pre class="idle"><span class="Keyword">if</span> ((_isVisible <span class="Keyword">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="Keyword">!</span>isParent) <span class="Keyword">||</span> iAmMaster <span class="Keyword">||</span> youCanPassIsSet) {
   <span class="Comment"><span class="Comment">//</span> do something...</span>
}
<span class="Comment"><span class="Comment">//</span> SOLUTION: For God's sake! you have to refactor this code.</span>
<span class="Comment"><span class="Comment">//</span> The least you can do is extracting a method out of it</span>
<span class="Comment"><span class="Comment">//</span> if you don't know any design patterns to apply. Check below:</span>
<span class="Keyword">if</span> (isValid()) {
   <span class="Comment"><span class="Comment">//</span> do something...</span>
} 
</pre>
  <p>When there is nested if/else statement: i.e </p>
  <pre class="idle"><span class="Keyword">if</span> (isThisTrue) {
   <span class="Keyword">if</span> (checkIfHeIsTheMaster() <span class="Keyword">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="Keyword">!</span>hmmmThisSeemsWeird()) {
      <span class="Comment"><span class="Comment">//</span> do something...</span>
   } <span class="Keyword">else</span> {
      <span class="Comment"><span class="Comment">//</span> do something else...</span>
   }
} <span class="Keyword">else</span> {
   <span class="Comment"><span class="Comment">//</span> this is just ugly...</span>
}
<span class="Comment"><span class="Comment">//</span> SOLUTION: Use well known OOP technique called *POLYMORPHISM*,</span>
<span class="Comment"><span class="Comment">//</span> or if the operator is one of (&gt;, &lt;, ==) then various possible</span>
<span class="Comment"><span class="Comment">//</span> design patterns like Strategy (behavior modification),</span>
<span class="Comment"><span class="Comment">//</span> Visitor (context evaluation) or Specification (item selection).</span>
<span class="Comment"><span class="Comment">//</span> If you're not happy, but you don't know what to do then talk</span>
<span class="Comment"><span class="Comment">//</span> to someone you think he/she might know. </span>
</pre>
  <p>Also if you are the maintainer of the code base then you might wanna introduce static
    code analyzers like <abbr>PMD</abbr>. They can easily detect <strong>cyclomatic complexities.</strong>
  </p>
  <p>Anyways, you guys can easily figure it out. You are welcome to introduce new ones. These are
    just some that I can think of in the middle of the night. </p>
  <h2>2. Stupid Loops</h2>
  <p>Folks, if you're introducing loops to your logic, please make sure that you really need them.
    Please check the code snippets and the solutions below; I don't wanna comment more about this: </p>
  <pre class="idle"><span class="Keyword">for</span> (<span class="Storage">int</span> i=<span class="Number">0</span>; i <span class="Keyword">&lt;</span> <span class="Number">2</span>; i<span class="Keyword">++</span>) {
   <span class="Keyword">if</span> (i <span class="Keyword">==</span> <span class="Number">0</span>) {
      doThis();
   } <span class="Keyword">else</span> <span class="Keyword">if</span> (i <span class="Keyword">==</span> <span class="Number">1</span>) {
      doThat();
   }
}
<span class="Comment"><span class="Comment">//</span> SOLUTION: how about this? You don't need loop there :S</span>
doThis();
doThat(); 
</pre>
  <p>One more:</p>
  <pre class="idle">item = <span class="BuiltInConstant">null</span>;
<span class="Keyword">for</span> (<span class="Storage">int</span> i=<span class="Number">0</span>; i <span class="Keyword">&lt;</span> items.size(); i<span class="Keyword">++</span>) {
   <span class="Keyword">if</span> (isVisible(items.get(i))) {
      item = items.get(i);
   }
}
<span class="Keyword">return</span> item;
<span class="Comment"><span class="Comment">//</span> SOLUTION: how about this? returning values directly?</span>
<span class="Keyword">for</span> (<span class="Storage">int</span> i=<span class="Number">0</span>; i <span class="Keyword">&lt;</span> items.size(); i<span class="Keyword">++</span>) {
   <span class="Keyword">if</span> (isVisible(items.get(i))) { <span class="Comment"><span class="Comment">//</span> EDIT from user comments</span>
      <span class="Keyword">return</span> items.get(i);
   }
}
<span class="Keyword">return</span> <span class="BuiltInConstant">null</span>; <span class="Comment"><span class="Comment">//</span> if possible even return new NullItem() </span>
</pre>
  <p>And please.. Very pretty please, stay the F away from the nested loops. I don't wanna even talk about it. </p>
  <h2>3. Dependency Injections</h2>
  <p>Woov, this one is an advanced topic ah? Everyone loves dependency injection. Spring sort of
    frameworks are even forcing you to do it this way right? Let me tell you something; I believe
    after go-to statements, this one is the most misinterpreted topic in programming history. We <strong>senior</strong> guys somehow convinced ourselves to something like this: </p>
  <blockquote>If you can inject it's cost free! </blockquote>
  <p>Man... just don't do this please. Everything has a cost.
    This is just a way to ease/loose your tight connections with your dependencies. Don't try to interpret otherwise. </p>
  <p>And second thing is the famous <em>setter injection.</em> So if you have a setter injection set up there, it means don't worry. It's like we can't think
    otherwise :S Opppss. Stop here! It is not like that at all if you still couldn't figure it out.
    Setter injection and Constructor injection are 2 well known ways of doing this (there are other
    ways too). Each of them has its own advantages/disadvantages. However, let's be honest.
    Constructor injection is much more declarative than setter injection. </p>
  <p>Anyways, it'a very big debate. I'm kinda scared :P People are gonna be offended again. I just wanna
    say that if possible please try to use constructor injection in your custom code. If you don't
    believe me, then refer to Martin Fowler's <a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/injection.html#ConstructorInjectionWithPicocontainer">IOC Article</a> or Misko Hevery's <strong>Clean Code</strong> talks at Google, such as <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlfLCWKxHJ0">Don't Look For Things</a>. </p>
  <h2>4. So Many Dependencies</h2>
  <p>Just a tiny comment here. Folks, try reading <abbr>SOLID</abbr> principles, ok. DON'T CREATE this much dependency :S The class itself is screaming at you: </p>
  <blockquote>I can't carry this much! You won't be able to test this, I've more than 1000 lines, You can't use constructor injection anymore! </blockquote>
  <p>Bottom line, if you have so many dependencies, please try to find a way to separate concerns. </p>
  <h2>5. So Many Parameters</h2>
  <p>You have more than 3-4 arguments? Re-consider that code. Probably you don't need that. I'm sure
    you can pull up something from that method or at least extract and call separately. </p>
  <h2>6. Pass What You Need</h2>
  <p>This bugs me a lot. Look at this: </p>
  <pre class="idle">calculateLoanForSomething(<span class="Storage">Account</span>, <span class="Storage">Customer</span>, <span class="Storage">World</span>);
<span class="Comment"><span class="Comment">//</span> here is the method</span>
<span class="Storage">void</span> <span class="FunctionName">calculateLoanForSomething</span>(<span class="Storage">Account</span> a, <span class="Storage">Customer</span> c, <span class="Storage">World</span> w) {
   <span class="Keyword">if</span> (w.date.time.hour <span class="Keyword">==</span> <span class="Number">11</span>) {
      <span class="Comment"><span class="Comment">//</span> do something here..</span>
   }
}
<span class="Comment"><span class="Comment">//</span> Why r u sending God objects everywhere :S</span>
<span class="Storage">void</span> <span class="FunctionName">calculateLoanForSomething</span>(<span class="Storage">Account</span> a, <span class="Storage">Customer</span> c, <span class="Storage">int</span> hour) { } 
</pre>
  <h2>7. Long Classes/Methods</h2>
  <p>Here is my rule of thumb: </p>
  <ul>
<li>Is it more than 20 lines? Refactor</li>
    <li>Is it more than 10 methods? Refactor</li>
    <li>Is it more than 5 package? Refactor</li>
    <li>Your colleague is coding? Please pair with him/her as much as you can especially if you
      think he/she is gonna introduce something bad. At least you can teach him/her or prevent
      things from happening. </li>
  </ul>
<p>I don't know if you guys are agree with me or not. I was so ashamed today and wanted to write
    this. It was more like a self relaxation. Please don't mind if I used a wrong sentence or
    anything. It's almost 2AM and I'm so tired. </p>
