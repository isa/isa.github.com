   p.brief
      ' Today I was browsing couple Django extensions to check if there is any new useful stuff around.
        I saw couple questions in those WiKis/forums about site-packages folder under OSX.

   p
      ' For those who don't know which
      u site-packages
      '  folder is active in your system, you must consider how your system is configured. Especially if
        you're using
      em MacPorts
      '  or any tool like that, your default site-packages folder that is shipped with OS X might be
        different than what you're presuming.

   p
      ' Anyways, the best way to learn what's your active site-packages folder, you can quickly learn
        it by typing:

   pre
      ' ::shell-unix-generic::
        python -c \
         "from distutils.sysconfig import get_python_lib;   \
          print get_python_lib()"

   p
      ' Or you can create a script like below and place it under your <em>/usr/bin</em> folder for
        further uses.

   pre
      ' ::python::
        from distutils.sysconfig import get_python_lib;
        print get_python_lib()
